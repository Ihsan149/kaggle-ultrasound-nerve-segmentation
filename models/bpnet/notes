1-11 invlalid becasuse train-val split is not patient based
12. 10 layer net
13. 5 layer net, better
14. 5 layer net, start with 16,  worse
14. 5 layer net, 32 with less augementation, scale_jitter and rotation are off, worse
15. 5 layer net, less augementation, scale_jitter and rotation less, worse
16. 5 layer net, more augmentation, no improvement, maybe a little bit less
17. 5 layer net, tried 1.0 contrast_jitter, 0.1 contrast_jitter is better, seems sensitive to intensity
18. 5 layer net, no contrast_jitter is no good, worse, seems best contrast_jitter is 0.1
19. 5 layer net, mean value is important, 50 is not good as 100
